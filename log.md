| 6-7-2025  | ± 1 hour    | - Took a good look at the assessment.<br />- Created the backbone.<br />- Set the database up.                                                                                                                                   | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6-7-2025  | ± 3 hours   | - I created all the pages im going to need in the future.<br />- Just messed around to get a better understanding of Laravel.<br />- Created functionality for logging in, logging out and registering <br />   a new account. | I used my copilot to refresh my knowledge on Laravel.<br />It helped me with using the most optimal build-in functions like middleware('auth').                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 7-7-2025  | ± 2 hours   | - I started creating the front end.                                                                                                                                                                                              | I decided to keep it simple since front-end is not my specialty. I created a components folder<br />where i created a header. This way i can reuse the header if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8-7-2025  | ± 3 hours   | - Created the first CRUD operations<br />- User movies are now being rendered on the my-list page                                                                                                                                | I used AI to help me with the database models here. I dont have alot of experience with using models in Laravel<br />and i dont have too much time to learn it right now, but im going to take a look at it after this assessment<br />for sure. Users can now create new movies and can see their personal list when going the the "my list" page.<br />I also seperated the JavaScript from the HTML. I am really struggeling with using branches in the right way. So far<br />I have only used branches when working in a team, not alone. I'm trying my best.                                                          |
| 8-7-2025  | ± 1,5 hours | - Created delete functionality for the users movies<br />- Created a modal component which looks alot cleaner<br />   then alerts. It can be used in multiple ways.                                                            | The deletion functionality was pretty easy to implement, so most of this hour was spent on the modal component.<br />Next up will be the edit functionality. After that, CRUD is fully complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 9-7-2025  | ± 2 hours   | - Created edit / update functionality<br />- Created a new editModal component                                                                                                                                                   | I had some trouble with getting the genres from the database to show on the edit modal, so i hard coded it.<br />It works fine this way, its just not dynamic at all. It's something i can improve another time though.<br />The CRUD is now fully complete. Next steps will be the integration of the IMDB API. Im not quite sure what im going<br />to do with it exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10-7-2025 | ± 2,5 hours | - Implemented the external API                                                                                                                                                                                                   | I used a IMDB API to fetch movies. Sadly it only returns a max of 10 movies when sending a query. So i made the overview only<br />show 5 movies at a time so i could show off pagination. I used AI here to help me with fetching right, since i had issues with getting the right response.<br />You can filter the results on "All", "Movies" or "TV Series". It works perfect now. I was planning on making it possible<br />to save searched movies to your personal list, but 1. i dont really have time for that no more, and 2. the API does not<br />give me the data that i would need for a personal list movie. |
