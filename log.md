| 6-7-2025 | ±1 hour  | - Took a good look at the assessment.<br />- Created the backbone.<br />- Set the database up.                                                                                                                                   | N/A                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6-7-2025 | ±3 hours | - I created all the pages im going to need in the future.<br />- Just messed around to get a better understanding of Laravel.<br />- Created functionality for logging in, logging out and registering <br />   a new account. | I used my copilot to refresh my knowledge on Laravel.<br />It helped me with using the most optimal build-in functions like middleware('auth').                           |
| 7-7-2025 | ±2 hours | - I started creating the front end.                                                                                                                                                                                              | I decided to keep it simple since front-end is not my specialty. I created a components folder<br />where i created a header. This way i can reuse the header if needed. |
