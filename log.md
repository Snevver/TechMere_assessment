| 6-7-2025 | ± 1 hour  | - Took a good look at the assessment.<br />- Created the backbone.<br />- Set the database up.                                                                                                                                   | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6-7-2025 | ± 3 hours | - I created all the pages im going to need in the future.<br />- Just messed around to get a better understanding of Laravel.<br />- Created functionality for logging in, logging out and registering <br />   a new account. | I used my copilot to refresh my knowledge on Laravel.<br />It helped me with using the most optimal build-in functions like middleware('auth').                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7-7-2025 | ± 2 hours | - I started creating the front end.                                                                                                                                                                                              | I decided to keep it simple since front-end is not my specialty. I created a components folder<br />where i created a header. This way i can reuse the header if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 8-7-2025 | ± 3 hours | - Created the first CRUD operations<br />- User movies are now being rendered on the my-list page                                                                                                                                | I used AI to help me with the database models here. I dont have alot of experience with using models in Laravel<br />and i dont have too much time to learn it right now, but im going to take a look at it after this assessment<br />for sure. Users can now create new movies and can see their personal list when going the the "my list" page.<br />I also seperated the JavaScript from the HTML. I am really struggeling with using branches in the right way. So far<br />I have only used branches when working in a team, not alone. I'm trying my best. |
| 8-7-2025 | ± 1 hour  | - Created delete functionality for the users movies<br />- Created a modal component which looks alot cleaner<br />   then alerts. It can be used in multiple ways.                                                            | The deletion functionality was pretty easy to implement, so most of this hour was spent on the modal component.<br />Next up will be the edit functionality. After that, CRUD is fully complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
